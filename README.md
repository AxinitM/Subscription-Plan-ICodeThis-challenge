## How it works

The user can select a subscription plan based on the number of downloads.
Subscription prices range from $10 for 10 downloads to $69 for 99 downloads.
After selecting a plan and clicking the "Subscribe" button, a modal window appears displaying the selected plan and a thank-you message.
The modal can be closed by clicking the "Close" button.
After closing the modal, the user is returned to the main subscription selection screen.
